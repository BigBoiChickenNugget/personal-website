			<p style="position: relative; top: 1rem;">
				This project revolved around the design of a wind turbine blade in relation to a certain scenario. Our group's scenario was "A Pioneer in Clean Energy"
				which required us to design a wind turbine blade for Sweden. The main purpose of the turbine farm in this scenario was to create a long term plan which can
				reduce Sweden's greenhouse gas emmisions to 0. Our group came up with the following main objectives:
			</p>
			<ul style="position: relative; top: 0.5rem;">
				<li>Should be sustainable. This means that the blade should be made out of "clean" materials while minimizing the carbon footprint. This would consider factors
				such as transportation and production of the materials used.</li>
				<li>Generates sufficient energy to power cities. This would be optimized through the design of the blade.</li>
				<li>Durability. The materials used should be strong and able to stand for long periods of time, which would allow the farm to stay alive without breaking down.</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="position: relative; top: 0.5rem;">
				The final objective tree is as follows:

				Throughout this project, our team managed to learn and apply the overall engineering design process. We were able to assign roles to each other as well as
				apply technical knowledge such as the usage of GRANTA and Autodesk Inventor to come up with a final deliverable. My role was that of a Subject Matter Expert (SME),
				which required me to be familiar with all of the sources used throughout this project by all members on our team. Moreover, I had to ensure the reliability of the
				sources used throughout this project. At the end of the project, I was one of two SMEs responsible for creating and submitting a Source Materials Database, which
				was a full and comprehensive list of all the sources used throughout the project.

				The outcome of our Granta analysis was to make a blade out of high carbon steel. We also decided to use a blade thickness of 15mm which we found had a maximum deflection
				of 9.744mm through our Autodesk Inventor stress analysis.
